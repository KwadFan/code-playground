# This folder contains python script to learn about basics

## Resources

I try to learn python in a self thought manner, so making bad decision might occure but as normal behaviour for humans, we learn from errors we made in the past. So, what resources I will use?
For now a Video from freecodecamp.org -> https://youtu.be/nLRL_NcnK-4
and https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_intro.asp

Also I use a printed media aka book :P named

[Python - Der Grundkurs](https://www.rheinwerk-verlag.de/python-der-grundkurs/)

As you you can guess it is written in my native language, german.

## helloworld.py

A basic structure that any python script should contain according to
https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html#source-code-encoding
and
https://realpython.com/if-name-main-python/

The main() function might be personal preference but I think its the way to go.
