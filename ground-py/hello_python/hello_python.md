# This folder contains python script to learn about basics

## helloworld.py

A basic structure that any python script should contain according to
https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html#source-code-encoding

https://realpython.com/if-name-main-python/

The main() function might be personal preference but I think its the way to go.
